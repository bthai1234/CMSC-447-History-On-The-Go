# CMSC-447-Project-Historical-Tours

Historical tours: A web app where users can select historical figures/events and the application will generate a list of sites nearby the user with historical relevance to the selected figure/event. For the sake of simplicity, the MVP of this system will be limited to a small collection of historical figures.
